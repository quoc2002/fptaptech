    <P>
        From my grandfather, Verus, I learned good morals
        and the government of my temper.
    </P>
    <P>
        From the reputation and remembrance of my father,
        modesty and a manly character.
    </P>
    <P>
        From my mother, piety and beneficence, and abstinence,
        not only from evil deeds, but even from evil
        thoughts; and further, simplicity in my way of living,
        far removed from the habits of the rich.
    </P>
    <P>
        From my great-grandfather, not to have frequented
        public schools, and to have had good teachers at home,
        and to know that on such things a man should spend
        freely.
    </P>
