    <title>Sam's Diner</title>
    <para>A huge truck passed by, eating up four whole lanes with its girth.
The whole back section was a glitzy passenger compartment trimmed in
chrome and neon. The roof sprouted a giant image of a hamburger with
flashing lights and the words, "Sam's Scruvi Soul Snax Shac". As it
sped past at foolhardy speed, I saw a bevy of cars roped to the back,
swerving back and forth.</para>
    <para>Included among these were:</para>
    <list>
      <listitem><para>a diesel-powered unicycle,</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>a stretch limousine about 50 yards
      long,</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>and the cutest little pod-cars shaped like spheres,
      with caterpillar tracks on the bottoms.</para></listitem>
    </list>
    <para>I made to intercept the truck, to hitch up my vehicle and climb
aboard.</para>
    <note>
      <para>If you want to chain up your car to a moving truck, you had better
know what you are doing.</para>
